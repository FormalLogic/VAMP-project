# Veggie-at-my-place (Python project)

Veggie at my place (VAMP) is an organisation where students are put into teams. The students within a team then cook food for each other over the next few weeks.

This notebook will tackle a problem which VAMP and many other student/organisations faces. The issue is how to assign the student into teams. Currently the teams are assigned manaully where an entire day is dedicated to group students together based on location, gender, etc...
